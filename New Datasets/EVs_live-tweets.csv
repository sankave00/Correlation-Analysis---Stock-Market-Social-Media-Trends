EVs	2023-04-20	@TSLAFanMtl The issue is Musk believes his personal brand is the Tesla brand. And his brand can never lose it's shine. His brands core is the wealth created for all his believers.

EVs	2023-04-20	@jameswoudhuysen Be interesting to learn how, in a densely populated town or city with high-rises housing a 100+ inhabitants, those with EVs will be able to find enough public charging points within a reasonable distance. Untenable.	1

EVs	2023-04-20	Nio and Chinese rivals such as Xpeng and BYD have set their sights on winning more customers abroad, especially in Europe, as demand weakens in China. Renault's Dacia brand, Tesla and BMW are among foreign brands making EVs in China and selling them abroad.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@JustinTrudeau EVs require slave labour. Those batteries require cobalt. There is no such thing as 'clean cobalt'. Cobalt mining is horrific and relies on slave labour that makes the 'workers' (which include kids, mothers with babies strapped to them, pregnant women etc) sick.	8

EVs	2023-04-20	@garyblack00 Margins are still the best in the industry even with recent price cuts. Legacy auto makes on average single digits margins. We are at a point where EVs are competitive in pricing with ICE cars. Isnt it a good thing?	1
EVs	2023-04-20	All the advertising in the world doesn't make a car out of reach for many people more in-reach for them simply by existing. What's Tesla's mission? To accelerate the transition. Ads aren't needed if demand is solely a function of price. For EVs, it's pretty clear they are.	2
EVs	2023-04-20	For Tesla, making EV products, the market is at LEAST the entire auto industry. (It is likely even larger than the current auto market, but for now let's keep it simple). So for Tesla the goal is to get EVs from 0% of the auto market to 100% of the market as quickly as possible.	2

EVs	2023-04-20	@elonmusk @JonErlichman $TSLA has the cash to pay dividends... Want to see this stock shoot up faster than the Starship? Start paying dividends....	1
EVs	2023-04-20	I kept telling you guys $tsla $167 starting December 2023 leaps.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@StealthQE4 $TSLA is the perfect stock to run the poor man's covered put strategy. Juicy premiums. One can buy the Dec '25 170 put option for $4100 and sell monthly puts against it. Let theta do its job. This shit of a stock ain't going back to ATH.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	$tsla down-6% AH	1
EVs	2023-04-20	Came close to looking at an EV but to be honest, they are just too expensive for the range. And just can't justify buying one given the advances that should be coming. And have crossed $TSLA off the list. Too many horror stories.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	$NVDA having a bigger market cap than $TSLA blows my mind. Tesla revenue in a quarter is just shy of a year for Nvidia	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@sspencer_smb @tavi_chocochip @TashaARK What other large manufacturer trades at PE 50 ? Don't compare yourself to legacy unless you believe $TSLA at $75 is fair price	1
EVs	2023-04-20	$TSLA going higher or lower tomorrow? What's your prediction, mine is going higher ?	1
EVs	2023-04-20	"So I know $TSLA's margins are already twice that of the competition in the Auto Industry. But I wish we knew a ""Relative Automotive Margin"" where we can compare margin of companies across the segment. Im sure if tesla's drops 10% others are falling 10% as well."	1
EVs	2023-04-20	We will not have the production specs and pricing of the Tesla Cybertruck before the delivery event in late Q3. $TSLA I think this is because there is insane demand for the product and Tesla does not need or want to increase the demand.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@ronjonbSaaS also kill its competitors while they are still no profitable and vulnerable, but $TSLA can still make a nice profit with a lower price. Taking market share.	1

EVs	2023-04-20	@EliteOptions2 How about $TSLA	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@aniljonline Roflmao! How is that tweet saying I am bullish $TSLA? I was indicating a meme possibility if 420 reaches on 4/20 because of good earnings on the stock.	1

EVs	2023-04-20	For those of you listening to the $TSLA earnings call.. #Tesla is a software/services company and they will continue to optimize for this. Selling hardware needed at a small profit to maximize long term value makes sense! Tesla is the company that #Apple should be...	1
EVs	2023-04-20	"$TSLA shillfluencers this morning... ""The price cuts won't touch margins, they're just passing on cost savings! Tesla's margins are a huge advantage over legacy auto!"" ...and this afternoon: ""Margin erosion doesn't change the narrative! Tesla wins even with 0% margins!"" $TSLAQ"	17
EVs	2023-04-20	So the quicker Tesla can get more cars on the road translates to faster rate of driving data collection. So cutting prices to increase the volume of cars on the road is a good thing $TSLA	1

EVs	2023-04-20	$TSLA has just revealed on their ER call that they're no longer an $AAPL type of company that can justify similar type of valuations but more like $AMZN circa 2015.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	Listening to the $TSLA Spaces. @cvalente28 very sincere & ; realistic. I agree with him 100%. The worst call in years. Mostly a consequence of worst economic environment in last 10 years, but management completely mismanaged the call & ; made it even worst than deserved. Completely	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@KJJKETH For sure. So. much. fun. All of my margin calls on $tsla have prepared me for shakeouts like this	1

EVs	2023-04-20	Of course it figures that as soon as I use fake money to buy $TSLA puts last week that expire 4/21 they're profitable but god forbid I use my real money, then suddenly all my picks flip and I lose everything.	1

EVs	2023-04-20	$TSLA is crashing bc Elon Musk's an idiot who's playing loose & ; fast w/ the money of the investors of all his companies. He sold them out so he could overspend to buy Twitter. This is all abt his selfish fascistic narcissism. Anyone who believed in him is a FOOL.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@AllVentured $TSLA is the number 1 luxury car in the world and is now cutting prices to expand market share. Foolish idiotically driven governments are moving to ban ICE cars. Tesla will be just fine	1

EVs	2023-04-20	@squawksquare My concern is - market continues to be red most of the days in a week - If $TSLA is trading below $170, where could $TSLA go in the coming days/weeks. How low it can print ? what stage $TSLA hold the bloodbath? hard to visualize. short sellers & ; puts will hit high coming days.	1
EVs	2023-04-20	@StockMKTNewz i think $tsla stays under $200 for EVER until @elonmusk appoints a replacement (team) for him at twitter and goes back to making the world's finest cars and getting us off this planet before the freaks ruin the entire thing.	1

EVs	2023-04-20	@Ross__Hendricks Suggesting that $TSLA the same as traditional auto makers is like saying the I- phone is the same as Nokia flip phone.
