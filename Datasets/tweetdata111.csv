Health	2023-03-14	While most auto companies are trying to figure out how to save minutes during manufacturing to compete with Tesla, Tesla is trying to figure out how to save seconds while competing with themself. A 3 year old can predict how this story ends. #TSLA $TSLA
Health	2023-03-14	VIXtrader: $TSLA. Rejection of the 178-180 level will likely drive $TSLA down to 61.8% of (v) at 155. Invalidation if $TSLA ; 180. #TSLA

Health	2023-03-14	Aralin: $TSLA $182 done, it can go down tomorrow. Next downside level would be $153. There is a chance the $163 was a rejection and it will return to origin around $205. Above $185 I'd consider that more likely. #TSLA
Health	2023-03-14	"@NealBrowning @perrochon @CorySteuben @live_munro @Tesla @elonmusk @LimitingThe Battery pack is a pool of energy and would never require on or off state. The states would be charging, discharging, full, or ""empty"". BMS would manage this energy pool to deliver energy to motors, sensors, electronics etc as needed. Why deep sleep needed?"

Health	2023-03-14	@theblackspiderm Early Tesla I guess
Health	2023-03-14	VIXtrader: $TSLA. I agree on your count of possible wave 4 going on now. I think we need to see it end below 185.95 which is the end of wave 1, else it will look a diagonal. The target for wave 5 is at/near 159. Let me know. #TSLA

Health	2023-03-14	A car shouldn't be just for driving. Even better an individual shouldn't even drive a car. Take back your life and take back your time. Use FSD beta in a monitored manner #tsla

Health	2023-03-14	@CorySteuben @Tesla @elonmusk @LimitingThe I'm expecting the next-gen will use iron-phosphate batteries to keep cost low. So, will a LiFePO Low Voltage battery be developed or is a regular lithium battery more suitable? If dissimilar batteries, will that integrate well with cooling system, etc?
Health	2023-03-14	Tesla walks away from 6.5 million in California Grants for super chargers because the regulation and payment systems were too cumbersome. Another One bites the dust @GavinNewsom @elonmusk @SpeakerMcCarthy

Health	2023-03-14	@mkryst70 @Wilfrid55B @Xil_llix @JustinTrudeau EQuinox this summer, Blazer in the fall, Silverado early 2024. Hummer is a loss leader to get the name out. The way Tesla started with the Roadster for the early adopters. Their SEMI is great, but is sucking up big battery resources from volume car business.

Health	2023-03-14	"TSLA-Stocks: TSLA did well today. Market did well in bouncing around key price level (181.05) today. Pushed through then reversed. Reversed again at the above resistance level (182.55) heading down to key price level only to reverse with a strong ""long"" move to close. #TSLA"
Health	2023-03-14	Most people will believe that future Tesla price cuts will point towards a demand problem. Few will realize that its their manufacturing, verticality, &amp; supply chain management that allows them to make EVs cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and . . . #TSLA $TSLA
