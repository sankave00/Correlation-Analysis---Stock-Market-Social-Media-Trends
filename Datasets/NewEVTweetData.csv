EVs	2023-03-13	With all the hoopla around Silicon Valley Bank i haven't seen much chatter about Elon exercising options to buy 10,500 $TSLA shares.. Now why would he do that.. its Pizza money... why not more? a lot more?.. at this price.. #TESLA	1

EVs	2023-03-13	@Axesdofight @TJCams @TeslaSynopsis @Tesla @elonmusk I agree with you, if we took action 5/10 years ago when experts realised global warming, then we wouldnt have to make tough choices	1
EVs	2023-03-13	@Mr_Hilali IMO if the company needs money to operate they have to sell when they have to sell. Dm and RM have put together an amazing team. Production late summer early fall.Tesla doesnt have work trucks.$Muln and Bollinger have both and they are innovative and unique B4 best in classWTW23	1
EVs	2023-03-13	@WhompyWombat Understand that driving thru puddles is dangerous with many EV. Will pull the splash shield right off. Also tesla would go good having an inspected by sticker somewhere - to show that these missing parts passed an internal inspection prior to delivery.	1
EVs	2023-03-13	@PeterGazdik @OfficialABQ @JohnDoe75692933 @Tesla Yes. For me, it happens on the same spot every morning or evening, even with AP off. Completely unrelated to blockage of the camera. Software bug.	1
EVs	2023-03-13	@williamlegate You lose general credibility by not stating where you obtained the photo and giving it context. To be clear, Im not defending Tesla.	1
